In this weeks project we were giving the task of editing/ cleaning up this companys page, to meet a certain amount of standards. So what I have done is clean up their html file, so that it flows and makes more logically sense. That being making sure the indentation were correct and adding comments where I saw fit. Along with that, was cleaning up the css file, which required me to consolidate alot of the redundant code into one class that would essential effect multiple.

## File types
